# Elevator Simulation Project

Welcome to the Elevator Simulation Project! This project is a simple Java simulation of an elevator system. It demonstrates the basic functionality of an elevator moving between different floors based on user requests.

## Project Overview

The Elevator Simulation Project consists of the following components:

- `Elevator` class: Represents the elevator's behavior, including moving between floors and processing requests.
- `Direction` enum: Represents the possible directions of the elevator (UP, DOWN, IDLE).
- `Request` class: Represents a user request for a specific floor and direction.

## Getting Started

To run the simulation on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kushil7145/YHills_CoreJava.git
